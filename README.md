# CarGarage

STEP 1 – In-Memory CRUD

## Problem

Develop a small command-line interface (CLI) application that manages a car garage. The application must allow CRUD operations on a set of cars stored in memory.

## Minimum Data Model (Car)

- `id` (String)
- `brand` (Brand)
- `model` (Model)
- `year` (Year)
- `plate` (License Plate)

## Required Functionalities

The menu must allow:

- List of cars
- Car detail by ID
- Add car
- Update car
- Delete car
- Exit

## Restrictions

- In-memory data (free structure)
- Minimum validations (unique ID, license plate cannot be null)
- Command-line user interface (UI)
